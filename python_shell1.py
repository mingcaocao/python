 |      Return -1 on failure.
 |  
 |  rindex(...)
 |      S.rindex(sub [,start [,end]]) -> int
 |      
 |      Like S.rfind() but raise ValueError when the substring is not found.
 |  
 |  rjust(...)
 |      S.rjust(width[, fillchar]) -> string
 |      
 |      Return S right-justified in a string of length width. Padding is

 |  rpartition(...)
 |      S.rpartition(sep) -> (head, sep, tail)
 |      
 |      Search for the separator sep in S, starting at the end of S, and return
 |      the part before it, the separator itself, and the part after it.  If the
 |      separator is not found, return two empty strings and S.
 |  
 |  rsplit(...)
 |      S.rsplit([sep [,maxsplit]]) -> list of strings
 |      
 |      Return a list of the words in the string S, using sep as the
 |      delimiter string, starting at the end of the string and working
 |      to the front.  If maxsplit is given, at most maxsplit splits are
 |      done. If sep is not specified or is None, any whitespace string
 |      is a separator.
 |  
 |  rstrip(...)
 |      S.rstrip([chars]) -> string or unicode
 |      
 |      Return a copy of the string S with trailing whitespace removed.
 |      If chars is given and not None, remove characters in chars instead.

 |  
 |  split(...)
 |      S.split([sep [,maxsplit]]) -> list of strings
 |      
 |      Return a list of the words in the string S, using sep as the
 |      delimiter string.  If maxsplit is given, at most maxsplit
 |      splits are done. If sep is not specified or is None, any
 |      whitespace string is a separator and empty strings are removed
 |      from the result.
 |  
 |  splitlines(...)
 |      S.splitlines(keepends=False) -> list of strings
 |      
 |      Return a list of the lines in S, breaking at line boundaries.

 |  
 |  startswith(...)
 |      S.startswith(prefix[, start[, end]]) -> bool
 |      
 |      Return True if S starts with the specified prefix, False otherwise.

 |      
 |      Return a copy of the string S with leading and trailing
 |      whitespace removed.

 |      characters, all remaining cased characters have lowercase.
 |  
 |  translate(...)
 |      S.translate(table [,deletechars]) -> string
 |      
 |      Return a copy of the string S, where all characters occurring
 |      in the optional argument deletechars are removed, and the
 |      remaining characters have been mapped through the given
 |      translation table, which must be a string of length 256 or None.
 |      If the table argument is None, no translation is applied and
 |      the operation simply removes the characters in deletechars.
 |  
 |  upper(...)
 |      S.upper() -> string
 |      
 |      Return a copy of the string S converted to uppercase.
 |  
 |  zfill(...)
 |      S.zfill(width) -> string
 |

    General notes on the underlying Mersenne Twister core generator:
    
    * The period is 2**19937-1.
    * It is one of the most extensively tested generators in existence.
    * Without a direct way to compute N steps forward, the semantics of
      jumpahead(n) are weakened to simply jump to another distant state and rely
      on the large period to avoid overlapping sequences.
    * The random() method is implemented in C, executes in a single Python step,
      and is, therefore, threadsafe.

    class Random(_random.Random)
     |  Random number generator base class used by bound module functions.
     |  
     |  Used to instantiate instances of Random to get generators that don't
     |  share state.  Especially useful for multi-threaded programs, creating
     |  a different instance of Random for each thread, and using the jumpahead()
     |  method to ensure that the generated sequences seen by each thread don't
     |  overlap.
     |  
     |  Class Random can also be subclassed if you want to use a different basic
     |  generator of your own devising: in that case, override the following
     |  methods: random(), seed(), getstate(), setstate() and jumpahead().
     |  Optionally, implement a getrandbits() method so that randrange() can cover
     |  arbitrarily large ranges.
     |  
     |  Method resolution order:
     |      Random
     |      _random.Random
     |      __builtin__.object
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __getstate__(self)
     |  
     |  __init__(self, x=None)
     |      Initialize an instance.
     |      
     |      Optional argument x controls seeding, as for Random.seed().
     |  
     |  __reduce__(self)
     |  
     |  __setstate__(self, state)
     |  
     |  betavariate(self, alpha, beta)
     |      Beta distribution.
     |      
     |      Conditions on the parameters are alpha > 0 and beta > 0.
     |      Returned values range between 0 and 1.
     |  
     |  choice(self, seq)
     |      Choose a random element from a non-empty sequence.
     |  
     |  expovariate(self, lambd)
     |      Exponential distribution.
     |      
     |      lambd is 1.0 divided by the desired mean.  It should be
     |      nonzero.  (The parameter would be called "lambda", but that is
     |      a reserved word in Python.)  Returned values range from 0 to
     |      positive infinity if lambd is positive, and from negative
     |      infinity to 0 if lambd is negative.
     |  
     |  gammavariate(self, alpha, beta)
     |      Gamma distribution.  Not the gamma function!
     |      
     |      Conditions on the parameters are alpha > 0 and beta > 0.
     |      
     |      The probability distribution function is:
     |      
     |                  x ** (alpha - 1) * math.exp(-x / beta)
     |        pdf(x) =  --------------------------------------
     |                    math.gamma(alpha) * beta ** alpha
     |  
     |  gauss(self, mu, sigma)
     |      Gaussian distribution.
     |      
     |      mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation.  This is
     |      slightly faster than the normalvariate() function.
     |      
     |      Not thread-safe without a lock around calls.
     |  
     |  getstate(self)
     |      Return internal state; can be passed to setstate() later.
     |  
     |  jumpahead(self, n)
     |      Change the internal state to one that is likely far away
     |      from the current state.  This method will not be in Py3.x,
     |      so it is better to simply reseed.
     |  
     |  lognormvariate(self, mu, sigma)
     |      Log normal distribution.
     |      
     |      If you take the natural logarithm of this distribution, you'll get a
     |      normal distribution with mean mu and standard deviation sigma.
     |      mu can have any value, and sigma must be greater than zero.
     |  
     |  normalvariate(self, mu, sigma)
     |      Normal distribution.
     |      
     |      mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation.
     |  
     |  paretovariate(self, alpha)
     |      Pareto distribution.  alpha is the shape parameter.
     |  
     |  randint(self, a, b)
     |      Return random integer in range [a, b], including both end points.
     |  
     |  randrange(self, start, stop=None, step=1, _int=<type 'int'>, _maxwidth=9007199254740992L)
     |      Choose a random item from range(start, stop[, step]).
     |      
     |      This fixes the problem with randint() which includes the
     |      endpoint; in Python this is usually not what you want.
     |  
     |  sample(self, population, k)
     |      Chooses k unique random elements from a population sequence.
     |      
     |      Returns a new list containing elements from the population while
     |      leaving the original population unchanged.  The resulting list is
     |      in selection order so that all sub-slices will also be valid random
     |      samples.  This allows raffle winners (the sample) to be partitioned
     |      into grand prize and second place winners (the subslices).
     |      
     |      Members of the population need not be hashable or unique.  If the
     |      population contains repeats, then each occurrence is a possible
     |      selection in the sample.
     |      
     |      To choose a sample in a range of integers, use xrange as an argument.
     |      This is especially fast and space efficient for sampling from a
     |      large population:   sample(xrange(10000000), 60)
     |  
     |  seed(self, a=None)
     |      Initialize internal state from hashable object.
     |      
     |      None or no argument seeds from current time or from an operating
     |      system specific randomness source if available.
     |      
     |      If a is not None or an int or long, hash(a) is used instead.
     |  
     |  setstate(self, state)
     |      Restore internal state from object returned by getstate().
     |  
     |  shuffle(self, x, random=None)
     |      x, random=random.random -> shuffle list x in place; return None.
     |      
     |      Optional arg random is a 0-argument function returning a random
     |      float in [0.0, 1.0); by default, the standard random.random.
     |  
     |  triangular(self, low=0.0, high=1.0, mode=None)
     |      Triangular distribution.
     |      
     |      Continuous distribution bounded by given lower and upper limits,
     |      and having a given mode value in-between.

     |  
     |  uniform(self, a, b)
     |      Get a random number in the range [a, b) or [a, b] depending on rounding.
     |  
     |  vonmisesvariate(self, mu, kappa)
     |      Circular data distribution.
     |      
     |      mu is the mean angle, expressed in radians between 0 and 2*pi, and
     |      kappa is the concentration parameter, which must be greater than or
     |      equal to zero.  If kappa is equal to zero, this distribution reduces
     |      to a uniform random angle over the range 0 to 2*pi.
     |  
     |  weibullvariate(self, alpha, beta)
     |      Weibull distribution.
     |      
     |      alpha is the scale parameter and beta is the shape parameter.

     |      Seed from hashable object's hash code.

     |      None or no argument seeds from current time.  It is not guaranteed
     |      that objects with distinct hash codes lead to distinct internal
     |      states.
     |      
     |      This is obsolete, provided for compatibility with the seed routine

FUNCTIONS
    betavariate(self, alpha, beta) method of Random instance
        Beta distribution.
        
        Conditions on the parameters are alpha > 0 and beta > 0.
        Returned values range between 0 and 1.
    
    choice(self, seq) method of Random instance
        Choose a random element from a non-empty sequence.
    
    expovariate(self, lambd) method of Random instance
        Exponential distribution.
        
        lambd is 1.0 divided by the desired mean.  It should be
        nonzero.  (The parameter would be called "lambda", but that is
        a reserved word in Python.)  Returned values range from 0 to
        positive infinity if lambd is positive, and from negative
        infinity to 0 if lambd is negative.
    
    gammavariate(self, alpha, beta) method of Random instance
        Gamma distribution.  Not the gamma function!
        
        Conditions on the parameters are alpha > 0 and beta > 0.
        
        The probability distribution function is:
        
                    x ** (alpha - 1) * math.exp(-x / beta)
          pdf(x) =  --------------------------------------
                      math.gamma(alpha) * beta ** alpha
    
    gauss(self, mu, sigma) method of Random instance
        Gaussian distribution.
        
        mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation.  This is
        slightly faster than the normalvariate() function.
        
        Not thread-safe without a lock around calls.
    
    getrandbits(...)
        getrandbits(k) -> x.  Generates a long int with k random bits.
    
    getstate(self) method of Random instance
        Return internal state; can be passed to setstate() later.
    
    jumpahead(self, n) method of Random instance
        Change the internal state to one that is likely far away
        from the current state.  This method will not be in Py3.x,
        so it is better to simply reseed.
    
    lognormvariate(self, mu, sigma) method of Random instance
        Log normal distribution.
        
        If you take the natural logarithm of this distribution, you'll get a
        normal distribution with mean mu and standard deviation sigma.
        mu can have any value, and sigma must be greater than zero.
    
    normalvariate(self, mu, sigma) method of Random instance
        Normal distribution.
        
        mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation.
    
    paretovariate(self, alpha) method of Random instance
        Pareto distribution.  alpha is the shape parameter.
    
    randint(self, a, b) method of Random instance
        Return random integer in range [a, b], including both end points.
    
    random(...)
        random() -> x in the interval [0, 1).
    
    randrange(self, start, stop=None, step=1, _int=<type 'int'>, _maxwidth=9007199254740992L) method of Random instance
        Choose a random item from range(start, stop[, step]).
        
        This fixes the problem with randint() which includes the
        endpoint; in Python this is usually not what you want.
    
    sample(self, population, k) method of Random instance
        Chooses k unique random elements from a population sequence.
        
        Returns a new list containing elements from the population while
        leaving the original population unchanged.  The resulting list is
        in selection order so that all sub-slices will also be valid random
        samples.  This allows raffle winners (the sample) to be partitioned
        into grand prize and second place winners (the subslices).
        
        Members of the population need not be hashable or unique.  If the
        population contains repeats, then each occurrence is a possible
        selection in the sample.
        
        To choose a sample in a range of integers, use xrange as an argument.
        This is especially fast and space efficient for sampling from a
        large population:   sample(xrange(10000000), 60)
    
    seed(self, a=None) method of Random instance
        Initialize internal state from hashable object.
        
        None or no argument seeds from current time or from an operating
        system specific randomness source if available.
        
        If a is not None or an int or long, hash(a) is used instead.
    
    setstate(self, state) method of Random instance
        Restore internal state from object returned by getstate().
    
    shuffle(self, x, random=None) method of Random instance
        x, random=random.random -> shuffle list x in place; return None.
        
        Optional arg random is a 0-argument function returning a random
        float in [0.0, 1.0); by default, the standard random.random.
    
    triangular(self, low=0.0, high=1.0, mode=None) method of Random instance
        Triangular distribution.
        
        Continuous distribution bounded by given lower and upper limits,
        and having a given mode value in-between.
        
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_distribution
    
    uniform(self, a, b) method of Random instance
        Get a random number in the range [a, b) or [a, b] depending on rounding.
    
    vonmisesvariate(self, mu, kappa) method of Random instance
        Circular data distribution.
        
        mu is the mean angle, expressed in radians between 0 and 2*pi, and
        kappa is the concentration parameter, which must be greater than or
        equal to zero.  If kappa is equal to zero, this distribution reduces
        to a uniform random angle over the range 0 to 2*pi.
    
    weibullvariate(self, alpha, beta) method of Random instance
        Weibull distribution.
        
        alpha is the scale parameter and beta is the shape parameter.
